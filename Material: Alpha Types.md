# Material: Alpha Types

There are three stages of **Alpha** in Second Life. They are **Opaque**, **Alpha Blended**, and **Alpha Masked**.

**Opaque** (aka **None**)
- This is a textureâ€™s default state without Alpha.
- Photoshop and Substance may export alpha layers. Only do this on purpose.
  
**Alpha Blending**
- **Alpha Blending** is reserved for things you must see through and nothing else.
- Suffers from **Alpha Sorting** issues that are common to almost all 3D graphics engines
- Most of the time creators should not use this as it causes CPU/GPU slowdown.
  
**Alpha Masking**
- **Alpha Masking** is the preferred method for doing anything that must feature alpha.
- The strength of the **Alpha Masking** effect is modulated via the number box 
- It is more efficient than Alpha Blending and suffers from no **Alpha Sorting** distortions
