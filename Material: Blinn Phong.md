There are two kinds of Materials in Second Life: Blinn-Phong and PBR glTF.

**Blinn-Phong** for the Specular Glossiness workflow (SpecGloss) is the older of the two and the one we are all most familiar with here in Second Life.
It has 3 slots:

Texture Slots

**Diffuse** (aka **DIFF**)

This is your basic color texture for an object
In Second Life **Blinn-Phong** objects **Diffuse** also has **Emission** in its **Alpha Channel**. 
JPEG, PNG, and TARGA live here

**Normal** (aka **NRML**)
Can store **Glossy** information in its **Alpha Channel**
This map is normally purple/blue coloured. It will give your mesh height and depth.

**Specular** (aka **SPEC**)
A Specular texture dictates how Rough or Shiny an object is
Environmental Intensity (more Glossy) in its **Alpha Channel**
