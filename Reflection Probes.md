# Reflection Probes

**Reflection Probes** are a **Prim** property that allows the capturing of reflections for IBL and HDR  
- **Reflection Probes** are a Sphere or Box  
- **Ambiance** is a setting that Affects how much objects within the volume are lit  
- **Near Clip** will make the Probe volume exclude objects N meters from the center so they donâ€™t get included in the reflection  
- Probe reflections can also be **Dynamic**. This means there is movement in the reflections  
- They can rotate and stretch like other objects but they cannot be changed in other ways other than Sphere, Box, Ambiance, or Near clip  
- They are Yellow in color and Blue when inside mesh geometry  

Below is a demonstration of Second Life's UI demonstrating how to show Reflection Probes and making them selectable.
